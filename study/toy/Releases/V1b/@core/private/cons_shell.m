% Chameleon Toolbox is based heavily on the object oriented programming
% technology. Don't panic if you are not familar with object oriented pro-
% gramming. We will give a practical introduction into the most important
% aspects which are necessary to utilize the power of Chameleon Toolbox.

% Chameleon Toolbox provides two kinds of core object classes: SMART and
% SHELL. In this section we want to focus on SHELL objects and try to un-

%
;; she = shell   % create a SHELL object with #GENERIC format
