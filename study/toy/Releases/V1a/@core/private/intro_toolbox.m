% CHAMELEON TOOLBOX - INTRODUCTION
% ================================
%
% Chameleon Toolbox is based heavily on object oriented programming tech-
% nology. Don't panic if you are not familar with object oriented pro-
% gramming. We will give a practical introduction into the most important
% aspects which are necessary to utilize the power of Chameleon Toolbox.
%
% Chameleon Toolbox provides two kinds of core object classes: SMART and
% SHELL. In the next sections we want to get an overview about the power
% of SHELL objects (these are objects based on class SHELL) and try to un-
% derstand them in some detail.
