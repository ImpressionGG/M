% SHELL OBJECTS
% =============
%
% In the context of operating systems 'shells' are usually interface layers
% covering a powerful core system, and interacting with the user in order
% to allow launching software applications and manipulation of data.
%
% In the context of MATLAB toolboxes it is useful to launch test programs,
% simulation tools and analyzation scripts by means of roll down menus
% which are attached to a menu bar on top of a figure (graphical window).
% Such kind of figure supported by a menubar and according functionality 
% can be considered as a graphical shell for a toolbox.
%
% The SHELL class of Chameleon Toolbox provides object functionality based
% on data and procedures (in object oriented programming these procedures
% who can directly access object's data are called 'methods') in order to
% setup graphical shells, menu definition and menu event handling by
% menu callbacks in a simple and efficient way.
