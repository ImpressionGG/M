% CORE OBJECTS
% ============
%
% In the context of MATLAB toolboxes it is useful to launch test programs,
% simulation tools and analyzation scripts by means of roll down menus
% which are attached to a menu bar on top of a figure (graphical window).
% Such kind of figure supported by a menubar and according functionality 
% can be considered as a graphical shell for a toolbox.
%
% The CORE class provides object functionality based on data and procedures
% (in object oriented programming these procedures who can directly access
% object's data are called 'methods') in order to setup graphical shells, 
% menu definition and menu event handling by menu callbacks in a simple and
% efficient way.
