% INTRODUCTION TO ROBO TOOLBOX
% ============================
%
% ROBO Toolbox is a tool set to analyze and model accurate robots.
% The data objects ROBO is dealing with are vector sets. ROBO toolbox
% is heavily using homogenious coordinate space, which both a smart and
% excellent approach to model robot kinematics.
%
% But also the calculation of approximated maps is an easy deal based on 
% homogenious coordinates.
